LiveHD is an infrastructure designed for Live Hardware Development. By live, we
mean that small changes in the design should have the synthesis and simulation
results in a few seconds, as the fast interactive systems usually response in
sub-second.

As the goal of "seconds," we do not need to perform too fine grain incremental
work. Notice that this is a different goal from having an typical incremental
synthesis, where many edges are added and removed in the order of thousands of
nodes/edges.


## LiveHD Framework
LiveHD is optimized for synthesis and simulation. The main components of LiveHD
includes LGraph, LNAST, integrated 3rd-party tools, code generation, and "live"
techniques. The core of LiveHD is a graph structure called LGraph (Live Graph).
LGraph is built for fast synthesis and simulation, and interfaces other tools
like Yosys, ABC, OpenTimer, and Mockturtle. LNAST stands for language neutral
AST, which is a high-level IR on both front/back-end of LGraph. LNAST helps to
bridge different HDLs and HLS into LiveHD and is useful for HDLs/C++ code
generation.

## Contribute to LiveHD

Contributors are welcome to the LiveHD project. This project is led by the
[MASC group](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu) from UCSC.

There is a list of available [projects.md](docs/projects.md) to further improve
LiveHD. If you want to contribute or seek for MS/undergraduate thesis projects,
please contact renau@ucsc.edu to query about them.


You can also
[donate](https://secure.ucsc.edu/s/1069/bp18/interior.aspx?sid=1069&gid=1001&pgid=780&cid=1749&dids=1053)
to the LiveHD project. The funds will be used to provide food for meetings,
equipment, and support to students/faculty at UCSC working on this project.

## Building
Read [Installation](./docs/Installation.md) for installation instructions.

## LiveHD Data Structures

LiveHD has several custom data structures, the two more important are
[LGraph](docs/lgraph.md) and [LNAST](https://masc.soe.ucsc.edu/lnast-doc).

LGraph (Live hardware Graph) is the graph-like data structure and associated
API inside LiveHD. LNAST (Language Neutral AST) is the tree-like structure and
associated API to easily create new input languages to LiveHD.

## InOu

InOus are inputs and/or outputs to/from LiveHD. An input will create a LGraph,
e.g., from a verilog description, an json representation, or randomly.
Similarly, an output will read an existing LGraph and generate an alternative
representation, eg., verilog or json.

Examples of inou can be found in inou/yosys (for verilog handling) and inou/json.

## Passes

Passes are transformations over an existing LGraph. In the future, there may be
passes over LNAST, but for the moment, we just have LGraph passes. A pass will
read an LGraph and make changes to it. Usually this is done for optimizations.
Examples of passes can be found in `pass/sample`, which compute the histogram
and count wire numbers of a LGraph.

## Style

For coding, please follow the coding styles from [Style.md](docs/Style.md). To contribute,
check [policy](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) document that explains how to create pull requests
and more details about license and copyrights. Also, contributors to LiveHD are
expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Code Organization

The code is organized as:

- [`core/`](./core) - All the core classes of LGraph (nodes, edges, iterators, field tables, ...)
- [`meta/`](./meta) - All the additional fields added to the nodes
- [`inou/`](./inou) - All the inputs and outputs to and from LGraph
- [`pass/`](./pass) - Transformations over LGraph
- [`cops/`](./cops) - Combine operations, ie. take N graphs and creates another graph
- [`misc/`](./misc) - External libraries and other misc code
- [`test/`](./test) - Testing code, scripts, cases and infrastructure (Note: unit tests
  should be placed inside the corresponding subfolder)
- [`docs/`](./docs) - Documentation of LiveHD

## Git Policies

Before pushing your code, make sure:

* The code builds `bazel build //...`
* The testbenches pass `bazel test //...`

Push frequently, if your code still has problems, use macros to turn parts of it
off:

```cpp
#if 0
//...
#endif
```

Pull at least once a day when working, LiveHD is in active development.

Always target warning free compilation. It is okay to commit code that triggers
warning during development, but remember to clean up afterwards.

If you are not one of the code owners, you need to create a pull request as
indicated in [CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) and [GitHub-use.md](docs/GitHub-use.md).
