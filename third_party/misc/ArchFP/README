This program generates hierarchical floorplans for the LiveHD fplan pass.

Note that the tofig.pl script (which converts .flp files generated by ArchFP to .png files for viewing) does not work very well.
The view.py script works much better, see pass/fplan for details.

See HOWTO for instructions on how to use ArchFP.
