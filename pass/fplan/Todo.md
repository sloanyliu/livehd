Plan:
1. Do SA floorplanner pass

1. Write/pull in a floorplanning method that actually works properly into ArchFP

    General idea:
    - if someone wants to manually provide hints to a module, use geogLayout for it (since it is assumed that the person knows what they're doing)
    - otherwise, use some other method to generate an initial floorplan (SA)
    - this initial floorplan is used to generate hints for the placer (it would be really cool if the floorplanner itself used some of the same hints!)

3. Find out what kind of hint information needs to be provided to pnr algorithm and pass it on
4. Work on creating methods for automatic hint insertion
    - better hints (place near here, put in this section, block divide design around here, put anchor points here, etc)
       - goal of the whole floorplanner project is to provide hints to placer!
       - anchor points are exact, but also want to be able to have hard lines between sections of a chip
       - give hints for anchor points!
       - adjust floorplan unit size with better granularity?

Possible Improvements:
1. Optimization
    - multithread the floorplanner (how to decide what layout() calls get spun off into threads?)
    - multithread the Lgraph traversal
       - create a way to floorplan using existing layouts
    - double -> float in ArchFP?  We use float everywhere else...

2. Incremental Floorplans
    - floorplan using existing geography hints/specific AR instead of randomly choosing a hint/using AR = 1.0
    - assign geography hints to nodes based on wirelength metrics
    - use HPWL as benchmark
    - easy: swap positions of leaves of the same type (within a hierarchy), see if HPWL gets better
    - identify components that are far away, set geography hints to be closer?

- Cleanup items:
    - implement blackboxes (FixedLayout.cpp needs work / error checking)
    - write back module-level floorplans to livehd (once node level is solid - node is much larger and reveals more errors)
    - get lg_hier and node_flat to take hints (currently only uses annLayout for everything)

Issues:
 - view.py output is flipped due to mismatch between coordinates for HotSpot and png coordinates in PyCairo
 - LiveHD does not function correctly with non-english names (rename broken, importing broken as well (non-ascii characters skipped?))

Tabled:
 - Cairo is LGPL, so it can't be shipped with LiveHD.  Python script is fine.
 - Lrand random class doesn't support floats, not using it for writearea pass
 - floorplaning node pins allows for more accurate HPWL estimation, but doing sub node-level floorplans isn't a job for LiveHD
